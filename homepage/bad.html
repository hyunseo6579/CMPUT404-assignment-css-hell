			About Me
		</h3>
		<p>Hello there, my name is Maristella Jho and I am a Korean born Canadian who is studying Computer Science at University of Alberta.</p>

		<h3>My History</h3>
		<p>I have over 6 years of work experience in customer service and worked as a game developer for over 1 year at Milo Productions.</p>

		<h3>What I Offer</h3>
		<p>I am an excellent communicator and a fast learner which would be a great asset for junior developer.</p>

		<h3>Important Note</h3>
		<p>I have been living alone without any financial assistant ever since I graduated highschool, so my GPA isn't perfect, but that's because I've always worked over 20 hours/week during school!
I assure you that if I had more free time, I would be an excellent student. Regardless, GPA is not everything and I am a very capable potential employee who is an amazing multi-tasker!</p>
